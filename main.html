	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input.As a Developer we should write efficient algorithm for solving a problems.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is defined as how much amount of space it requred for solving a problem for example for linear search it required space of O(n).</p>
